# Matomo Bandwidth Plugin

[![Build Status](https://github.com/matomo-org/plugin-Bandwidth/actions/workflows/matomo-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=4.x-dev)](https://github.com/matomo-org/plugin-Bandwidth/actions/workflows/matomo-tests.yml)

## Description

This plugin allows you to measure the bandwidth that was used by each page view or download. 
It enriches existing reports and APIs to show the used bandwidth.

This feature only works when using the plugin in combination with our [Log Analytics tracking method](https://matomo.org/log-analytics/) or if you use our HTTP Tracking API directly. It does not work with our standard JavaScript or image tracker. Find more information in the FAQ.
